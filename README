The short story:

The legendary @jtopper once humorously tweeted about the distraction of a fellow work who insisted on dancing in his chair to some music blaring from his headphones.

Imagining this I laughed even though I could not see the dancing. Then I thought how "common" this issue is. People who have completely forgotten there in the real world and are lost in their music while sitting in a public place / office. 

I thought it would be interesting to see how common this sight is and if it is how good these people really are at chairdancing.

Thus the project. To create a simple site where people can submit video of chair dancers and we can all vote on who is the best.
